# Image to WebP Converter

This is a simple web application that allows you to upload JPEG, JPG, and PNG images and convert them to the WebP format. The conversion process is handled on the server-side using PHP.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your web server's directory.

2. Ensure that your PHP installation has the GD library enabled, as it is required for image manipulation.

3. Access the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will see a simple upload form.

4. Choose an image file (JPEG, JPG, or PNG) using the "Choose File" button.

5. Click the "Convert to WebP" button to initiate the conversion process.

6. The converted WebP image will be sent to your browser for download. You can save it on your local machine.

## Important Notes

- This example is meant for educational purposes and provides a basic implementation. In a production environment, you should consider additional security measures and error handling.

- Make sure to configure your web server and PHP settings appropriately for security and performance.

- The temporary converted image files are cleaned up after download. However, in a production environment, you might want to implement a more robust cleanup strategy.

- Contributions and improvements to this example are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
